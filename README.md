# Indoor Location System Using FingerPrint and Machine Learning

We compared different algorithms in order to estimate the user position using the RSSIs collected from user's mobile device.

By and large, the FingerPrint algorithm is used in this task. We evaluated the Fingerprint's performace and compared it with machine learning models such as kNN, SVM and Random Forest.
